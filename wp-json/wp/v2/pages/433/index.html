Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Minimum Requirements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bobcoin Core full nodes have certain requirements. If you try running a node on weak hardware, it may work\u2014but you\u2019ll likely spend more time dealing with issues. If you can meet the following requirements, you\u2019ll have an easy-to-use node.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Desktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.<\/li><li>7 gigabytes of free disk space, accessible at a minimum read\/write speed of 100 MB\/s.<\/li><li>2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)<\/li><li>A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second<\/li><li>An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn\u2019t exceed its upload limits. It\u2019s common for full nodes on high-speed connections to use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20 gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 340 gigabytes the first time you start your node.<\/li><li>6 hours a day that your full node can be left running. (You can do other things with your computer while running a full node.) More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.<\/li><li><strong>Note:<\/strong>&nbsp;many operating systems today (Windows, Mac, and Linux) enter a low-power mode after the screensaver activates, slowing or halting network traffic. This is often the default setting on laptops and on all Mac OS X laptops and desktops. Check your screensaver settings and disable automatic \u201csleep\u201d or \u201csuspend\u201d options to ensure you support the network whenever your computer is running.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Possible Obsticales<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Legal:<\/strong>&nbsp;The use of cryptocurrencies are prohibited or restricted in some areas.<\/li><li><strong>Bandwidth limits<\/strong>: Some Internet plans will charge an additional amount for any excess upload bandwidth used that isn\u2019t included in the plan. Worse, some providers may terminate your connection without warning because of overuse. We advise that you check whether your Internet connection is subjected to such limitations and monitor your bandwidth use so that you can stop Bobcoin Core before you reach your upload limit.<\/li><li><strong>Anti-Virus<\/strong>: Some anti-virus programs quarantine the Bobcoin, making it more difficult to run Bobcoin Core. This problem mostly affects computers running Windows.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Initial Block Download<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initial block download&nbsp;refers to the process where nodes synchronize themselves to the network by downloading blocks that are new to them. This will happen when a node is far behind the tip of the&nbsp;best block chain. In the process of IBD, a node does not accept incoming transactions nor request mempool transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are trying to set up a new node following the instructions below, you will go through the IBD process at the first run, and it may take a considerable amount of time since a new node has to download the entire block chain. During the download, there could be a high usage for the network and CPU (since the node has to verify the blocks downloaded), and the client will take up an increasing amount of storage space (<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/full-node#reduce-storage\">reduce storage<\/a>&nbsp;provides more details on reducing storage).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the node finishes, you will not be able to see a new transaction related to your account until the client has caught up to the block containing that transaction. So your wallet may not count new payments\/spendings into the balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using Bobcoin Core GUI, you can monitor the progress of IBD in the status bar (left bottom corner).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"947\" height=\"648\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IDB.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-428\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IDB.png 947w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IDB-300x205.png 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/IDB-768x526.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Linux Instructions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no binaries for mainstream linux distributions.

Windows will ask you to confirm that you want to run it. Click Yes and the Bobcoin installer will start. It\u2019s a typical Windows installer, and it will guide you through the decisions you need to make about where to install Bobcoin Core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bobcoin Core GUI will begin to download the block chain. This step will take at least several days, and it may take much more time on a slow Internet connection or with a slow computer. During the download, Bobcoin Core will use a significant part of your connection bandwidth. You can stop Bobcoin Core at any time by closing it; it will resume from the point where it stopped the next time you start it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After download is complete, you may use Bobcoin Core as your wallet or you can just let it run to help support the Bobcoin network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Warning:<\/strong>&nbsp;to prevent data corruption, do not force shutdown of your computer from the Windows shutdown screen when you have Bobcoin Core running.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Network Configurations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to support the Bobcoin network, you must allow inbound connections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Bobcoin Core starts, it establishes 8 outbound connections to other full nodes so it can download the latest blocks and transactions. If you just want to use your full node as a wallet, you don\u2019t need more than these 8 connections\u2014but if you want to support other full nodes on the network, you must allow inbound connections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Servers connected directly to the Internet usually don\u2019t require any special configuration. You can use the testing instructions below to confirm your server-based node accepts inbound connections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Home connections are usually filtered by a router or modem. Bobcoin Core will request your router automatically configure itself to allow inbound connections to Bobcoin\u2019s port, port 9718. Unfortunately many routers don\u2019t allow automatic configuration, so you must manually configure your router. You may also need to configure your firewall to allow inbound connections to port 9718.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is a Full Node?
